The world of Wandering Bastion is a mixing pot of cultures from across the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../place/plane/index.md). As such, many languages have come here or have come to be developed here. Here's a list of languages common to this setting and a brief description of their nature.

| ***Language***                           | ***Description***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Common**                               | A set of languages with a common root, which was created collectively between the elves and humans in the days after the [Great Evacuation](../event/history/void/great-evacuation.md). Because of the world-wide mixing of cultures, these languages are more like dialects of the same language, and it's more or less possible for people to understand each other, even if they use different common languages. |
| **Ancient**                              | A single language that, for unknown reasons, was spoken on each of the [Five Lost Planets](../place/planet/5-lost-planets.md) since long before the beginning of written history. It is commonly associated with the [Pantheon of the Ancients](../creature/unique/deity/ancient/index.md) and high society or urban life.                                                                                          |
| **Wild Speech**                          | A set of languages spoken by people who spend their lives in or close to the edge of the wilds. Over the millennia, these languages have co-mingled enough that people who know one of them are likely to know most of them. This language is not a secret language like Druidic is.                                                                                                                                |
| **Dead Speech**                          | A languages spoken by thieves, undead, and other people that go against the ways of common society. Although not a secret language like Thieves' Cant, this language is rarely spoken in polite society. It originates from the [Unholy Lands of Frostchurch](../place/state/frostchurch/index.md).                                                                                                                 |
| **Undercommon**                          | A language that comes from communities living in the [[Deeplands]], cave systems deep underground. It's often associated with the [Uncanny Realities](../place/plane/prime/uncanny/index.md). It's said that it was first taught by someone who managed to return from the [Chasmic Caverns](../place/plane/prime/uncanny/chasmic-caverns.md).                                                                      |
| **Draconic**                             | A language that originates from [Vladnir](../place/planet/glyph/vladnir.md), the home planet of [Dragons](../creature/species/dragon/index.md), Dragonborn, and Kobolds. Today, it's mostly learnt in communities focused on study, perfecting a trade, or mastering some talent. It is still the primary language of [Dragons](../creature/species/dragon/index.md).                                               |
| **Giant**                                | A language that originates from [Kaer-Andorn](../place/planet/glyph/kaer-andorn.md), the home planet of [Giants](../creature/species/giant/index.md), Dwarfs, and Orcs. Today, it's mostly taught in places where toughness, hard work, and toil is held in high regard, and it's still practiced by [Giants](../creature/species/giant/index.md) today.                                                            |
| **Sylvan**                               | A language that came to Dunfoyn by way of [Aelfar](../place/planet/glyph/aelfar.md), the home planet of [Fey](../creature/species/fey/index.md), Elves, and Gnomes. Today it's mostly taught in places where magic or curses can be found.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran          | Languages from the [Inner Planes](../place/plane/inner/index.md) and spoken largely by [Elementals](../creature/species/elemental/index.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Abyssal, Celestial, Iconic, and Infernal | Languages from the [Outer Planes](../place/plane/outer/index.md) and spoken largely by [Celestials](../creature/species/celestial/index.md), [Fiends](../creature/species/fiend/index.md), and [Icons](../creature/species/icon/index.md).                                                                                                                                                                          |

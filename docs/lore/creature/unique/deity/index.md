Deities are beings capable of bestowing spellcasting and other gifts upon their worshippers. That is the most basic element that defines deism. Many deities, however, share other common traits, such as immortality, some level of prescience, and incredible magical power.

Deities come in 3 main categories:

- Demigods and demigoddesses are creatures with only a minor ability to grant spellcasting. They tend to have only 3 domains. They usually cannot die from old age but can be killed in combat. However, they are also usually strong enough to pose a great threat to the most powerful of adventurers, even when working together as a party. Most Archdevils, Demon Lords, Angelic Icons, and so on are good examples of demi-deities.
- Lesser Deities grant their spellcasters 4 domains. It is understood that they can die, but how is largely unknown. Even the most powerful mortals in existence could not defeat a Lesser Deity in combat.
- Greater Deities grant their spellcasters 5 domains. It is not known whether or not they can die, even by one anothers' hand. Dead bodies of lost deities exist in the [Astral Plane](../../../place/plane/transitive/astral.md), but it is unknown whether any of them were Greater Deities in life.

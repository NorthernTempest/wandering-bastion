The Pantheon of the Ancients is a collection of some of the most recognizable deities celebrated in the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../../../../place/plane/index.md). The deities of the Pantheon of the Ancients have been present in the Hourglass Cosmogony since before civilization formed, and are therefor older than recorded history. Although there are both older and younger deities, they belong to other pantheons (the Pantheon of the Originators and the Pantheon of the Ascended, respectively) and are less widely worshipped.

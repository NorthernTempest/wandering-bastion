Aberrations, as a rule, are the common enemy of all creatures native to the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../../../place/plane/index.md). They come from beyond the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../../../place/plane/index.md), a place called the [Void Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/void-chaos.md). Every known form of life but aberrations rely in some fashion on the pure power of creation of the [Primal Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/primal-chaos.md). They do not. Instead, they seem to take anything they can from our cosmogony, deconstruct it into something similar to the [Primal Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/primal-chaos.md), and take it away, presumably back to the [Void Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/void-chaos.md) that they come from.

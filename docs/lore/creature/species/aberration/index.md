Aberrations are the common enemy of all creatures native to the [Hourglass Cosmology](../../../place/plane/index.md). They do not require the energies from the [Primal Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/primal-chaos.md) that we need in order to live. Instead, they've come from beyond the [Outer Planes](../../../place/plane/outer/index.md), a place we call the [Void Chaos](../../../place/plane/beyond/void-chaos.md)

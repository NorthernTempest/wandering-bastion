Beasts are natural animals native to the [Material Plane](../../../place/plane/prime/material.md) that never developed a civilization and never developed a native spoken language. Most have no magical attributes, although there are exceptions. Animals from insects to mammals to dinosaurs and more are all under the category of Beasts.

Icons are much like [Fiends](../fiend/index.md) or [Celestials](../celestial/index.md), they are beings native to the [Outer Planes](../../../place/plane/outer/index.md). The one major difference is that Icons, instead of being Good or Moral-aligned, like [Celestials](../celestial/index.md), or Evil or Impure-aligned, like [Fiends](../fiend/index.md), are either neutrally aligned on the Good to Evil axis of alignment or are unaligned.

L'Arc Chantante is an ancient cathedral of incredible size. The cathedral is dedicated to the goddess [Arcundus](../../creature/unique/deity/core/arcundus.md).

The massive interior chamber where service is performed is estimated to be around 800 feet tall, and 1300 feet long, and 500 feet wide at its widest. Unlike Christian cathedrals, the footprint of L'Arc Chantante is shaped like a half ellipse, the walls angling inwards towards the Eastern wall, giving the impression that the room is about twice as far away from the entrance than it actually is.

L'Arc Chantante is located on the opposite side of the river from the town of [Ybbrinth](../state/great-alliance/arsleaf-peninsula/ybbrinth.md). To get there from the town, you must cross a small foot bridge, walk up a steep hill with a switchback path and irregularly placed battlements, and cross a 200 ft long field, where you'll find the Cathedral nestled between two towering 240 foot cliffs, angled away from each other. The entrance to the building sits on the Western side. The enormous steel doors are around 250 feet tall and 150 feet wide. Inside, 

Along with the main cathedral itself, several dozen buildings have been erected along the field leading up to the main cathedral. Some are bunk rooms for visitors or staff. Some are service buildings or storage facilities.

Countless additions have been constructed over and over again across the many years the cathedral has stood, adding to the structure in complex ways. As a result, the building is made from many different materials. The earliest construction seems to be mostly wood and daub, establishing what's believed to be the core original structure. The size of the original structure, however, defies immediate explanation. Wooden beams and daub are not normally capable of such heights. Magic is, of course, the natural first guess.

On the summer solstice, the Cathedral hosts thousands of devotees to [Arcundus](../../creature/unique/deity/core/arcundus.md), as part of the [Sunspark Festival](../../event/recurring/holiday/sunspark-festival.md).

#### ***Allied City-states of Bygone Paragons***

The eight city-state members of this alliance and the lands that surround them were once tranquil coastal lands populated only sparsely with the occasional monster or bandit. Those days are long gone now. Some 230 years ago, a massive fleet of ships bearing heavy artillery were spotted on the horizon. This vast armada of pirates began the first of a series of campaigns of raiding and pillaging. Every five to fifteen years since then, the fleets of the pirate empire Razig have swept through the allied cities, sacking and destroying the farms, cities, and villages. Under the oppression of constant assault, these lands have greatly suffered. Ruins lay scattered in cities and the countryside. Streets are clogged with wreckage and debris while many properties lie empty and abandoned after their owners were killed or forced to move elsewhere to rebuild their lives.

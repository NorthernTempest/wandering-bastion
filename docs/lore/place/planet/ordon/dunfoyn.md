***The Wandering Bastion***

Dunfoyn is the final safe haven from the [Aberrant Horde](../../../creature/species/aberration/index.md) in all of the [Material Plane](../../plane/prime/material.md). Since the [[Five Errant Gates]] brought the surviving life of the [[5 last planets]] to Dunfoyn 40,000 years ago, Dunfoyn has been free from the threat of [Aberrations](Aberrations). That is until the [[Ifvra Party Encounter]]

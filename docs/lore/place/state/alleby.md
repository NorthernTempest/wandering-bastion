### Description

Until 80 years ago, the soft rolling hills from to were a monarchical society ruled over by The High Hill King, a title passed down the Archwind family line. After the events of the Spotless Sun Cult Murders, riots backed by the military called for a constitutional monarchy which the royal family agreed to after a 23 week long civil war.

The first election was overseen by the military and the military backed party was elected to power. Since then, The National Party of Alleby has established a totalitarian regime that has stood virtually unopposed since its founding.

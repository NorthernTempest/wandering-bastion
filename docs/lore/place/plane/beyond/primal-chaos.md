It is said that the Primal Chaos is that from which we draw everything. Sitting beyond the [Inner Planes](../inner/index.md), the Primal Chaos is what those planes draw from to create infinite material, energy, and life force, and thereby how all those things come to be in the [Material Plane](../prime/material.md). In essence, the Primal Chaos is the source of everything we know. Only creatures from the [Void Chaos](void-chaos.md), the [Aberrations](../../../creature/species/aberration/index.md), are not created from the Primal Chaos.

Do not go here. The essence of the plane is immeasurably powerful and kills all but the most powerful creatures at a touch. Even [Deities](../../../creature/unique/deity/index.md) are said to be unable to enter. No one can know if there is anything inside the Primal Chaos

title: Inner Planes
---

The Inner Planes are planes of elemental energy, material, dimensions, and life force. They, being closer to the [Primal Chaos](../beyond/primal-chaos.md), draw from it in order to form their contents. Between the Inner Planes and the [Material Plane](../prime/material.md) sits the [Ethereal Plane](../transitive/ethereal.md).

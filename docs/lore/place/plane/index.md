The planes of this reality and the way theyâ€™re organised is called the hourglass cosmogony. The cosmogony takes the approximate form of an hourglass or, geometrically, a bicone. It is composed of two cones that intersect at their points or apexes where the material plane and planes that mirror the material are found.

The first cone is composed of the planes concerning the material world. This includes the ethereal, elemental, and dimensional planes. Beyond the sits the Plane of Primal Chaos

The second cone is composed of the planes concerning the metaphysical spirit and includes the astral and outer planes.

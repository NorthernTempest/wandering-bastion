The Outer Planes are 27 Planes of existence in the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../index.md) that each represent one of the 25 [Alignments](../../../concept/alignment.md). One of these [Alignments](../../../concept/alignment.md), the True Neutral alignment, receives three planes, the [Central Outer Planes](central/index.md).

Mobius is the [Central Outer Plane](index.md) which represents neutrality through the mixing of many different ideals. Here, [[Devils]] shake hands with [[Angels]], [[Demons]] walk the same streets as [[Archons]], and even [Deities](../../../../creature/unique/deity/index.md) with diametrically opposed ideals can agree to disagree while visiting.

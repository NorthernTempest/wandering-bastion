The Central Outer Planes are three different planes representing three different aspects of the True Neutral [Alignment](../../../../concept/alignment.md). The planes are:

- The [Plains of Asphodel](asphodel.md), which represents neutrality through inaction,
- [Mobius](mobius.md), which represents neutrality through the mixing of many different ideals, and
- [Pinnacle](pinnacle.md), which represents neutrality through deliberate action.

The Plains of Asphodel are one of the [Central Outer Planes](index.md), representing one aspect of the [Alignment](../../../../concept/alignment.md) of True Neutral. Specifically, the Plains of Asphodel represent inaction. They represents the aimless masses who do not aspire towards any ideal. As such, this plane could be considered one of the greatest tragedies in the [Hourglass Cosmogony](../../index.md).

The Plains of Asphodel are the largest of the [Central Outer Planes](index.md) since the vast majority of souls which are aligned True Neutral never achieve anything significant enough in their lives to qualify for any other [Alignment](../../../../concept/alignment.md). In the case of such poor souls, it might be more accurate to call them *unaligned* rather than True Neutral. The dead souls that wander this plane, called 'petitioners' as a general term across the [Outer Planes](../index.md), are called the Aimless. In their mortal lives, most of them never had the *opportunity* to achieve anything of worth due to low social standing or financial disadvantage. For such Aimless, having to eternally wander these featureless planes is a final cruel injustice born entirely out of the injustices they faced in their mortal life.

Because of the worthless nature of the Aimless, this Plane cannot generate or sustain the existence of any [Icons](../../../../creature/species/icon/index.md), the native beings born of all other Planes that are neutrally-aligned along the Good to Evil axis. As such, the Aimless are the only creatures that exist on this Plane, other than the exceedingly rare visitor. There is no reason to come here. There is no value in being here. Only worthless things exist here, as tragic as that may be to say.

To describe the physical nature of this Plane, it is featureless. Gravity, time, and all other defining traits of the plane are all normal. The flatlands that the Plane takes the form of are vast, grey, uniform, boring, empty, and flat, with no semblance of life at all. The pale waifish souls of the Aimless are the only unusual existence there, and they are so empty of value that it can be difficult to even perceive their presence, despite their collective omnipresence. Even the 'soil,' so to speak, is featureless. It is neither crumbly like sand, nor squishy like mud. Neither hard like stone, nor soft like loam. It is there, and that's all it can ever amount to.

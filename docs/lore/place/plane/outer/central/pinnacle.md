Pinnacle is one of the three [Central Outer Planes](index.md), which are all True Neutral in [Alignment](../../../../concept/alignment.md). This Plane represents neutrality through deliberate action. Pinnacle is where the souls of those who chose to take the neutral stance come to rest. It is exceedingly rare to go through life while choosing to not take a side in life-changing conflicts. In cases where neither side is *explicitly* correct or each side is correct on some points but wrong on others, sometimes the right answer is to take the neutral stance.

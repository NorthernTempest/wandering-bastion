The War of Clashing Planes was a conflict between two groups of [Deities](../../../creature/unique/deity/index.md) arguing over whether to protect the surviving life on the [Material Plane](../../../place/plane/prime/material.md) or to destroy the plane in its entirety and start over. At least one hundred deities were killed in the war, but only a few of their names are still remembered today. The war spans the entirety of the [Epoch of Clashing Planes](index.md), some 15,000 years.

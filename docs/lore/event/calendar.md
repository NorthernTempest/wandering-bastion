This page lists the different Calendars native to the [Wandering Bastion](../../index.md) campaign setting.

## Aelfaran Calendar

The majority of citizens of [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md) use the calendar originally created by the Elves and Gnomes native to [Aelfar](../place/planet/plaer/aelfar.md) shortly after their arrival at [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md). It is notably extremely accurate in terms of leap dates. Reportedly, humans found that the Aelfaran calendar closely matched the calendars that they used on [Earth](../place/plane/inner/matter/earth). Rather than determining the date by the month like with the Gregorian Calendar (which was used by humans back on Earth, where they came from), the date is usually written <Day\> <Week\> <Season\> <Year\> <Epoch\>. e.g., the 231st day of the year 640 ELS (Epoch of the Last Stand) would be written Turns Day of the 6th Week of Summer, 640 ELS.

### Years

#### Extra Days & Leap Years

Each year, there are 5 or 6 days not associated with any given month. Each of the solstices and equinoxes are not part of any months, but they do mark the first day of each season. In addition, New Year's Day, on the day before the Winter Solstice, is not associated with any months or seasons. On leap years, there is an additional extra day between New Year's Day and the Winter Solstice. Leap years occur every year divisible by 4 but not on years divisible by 128 or 4996, starting from New Year's Day of 0 EWU (Epoch of Worlds United).

### Seasons

Each year is split into 4 seasons of 91 days each. The first day of each season is the equinox or solstice associated with that season. In reality, seasons are irregular across [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md), as its orbit is oblique and elliptical and its axis of rotation is at a high angle. The *traditional* seasons, in order, are as follows. Entries in parentheses are not part of any season.

- (New Year's Day)
- (a Leap Day if it's a leap year)
- Winter, beginning on the Winter Solstice
- Spring, beginning on the Spring Equinox
- Summer, beginning on the Summer Solstice
- Fall, beginning on the Fall Equinox

### Months

There are 12 months per year, three for each season. Each month is 30 days long. The months of the year, in order, are as follows. Months are used only colloquially and usually when referring to what time of the season it is. Entries in parentheses are not part of any month and, notably, the months were named from the perspective of people living in the northern hemisphere.

- (New Year's Day)
- (a Leap Day if it's a leap year)
- (Winter Solstice)
- Dark-Frost. This month falls on the darkest and coldest days of the year.
- Sleep-Frost. In agricultural communities, there tends to be less work to be done during this month.
- Melting-Frost. At this point of the year, winter starts to warm up and rivers start to flow again.
- (Spring Equinox)
- River-Bloom. Rivers start flowing and even flooding around this 
- Song-Bloom
- Cinder-Bloom
- (Summer Solstice)
- Flam-Sun
- Storm-Sun
- Setting-Sun
- (Autumn Equinox)
- Ash-Leaf
- Fog-Leaf
- Last-Leaf

### Weeks

There are 13 weeks per season. Each week is 7 days long. The length of the week was chosen because 91, the number of days in a month, only has the factors 1, 7, 13, and 91. 7 was preferred over 13 because 7 days of the week was easier to remember than 13. Each season begins on a Sun day, which is the equinox or solstice of that season, and ends on a Star day. New Year's Day and any Leap Days do not count as days of the week.

### Days

There are 7 days per week. Each day is 24 hours long. Each day represents one rotation of [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md). Noon takes place at the local zenith of the common centre of orbit between [Ordon A](../place/planet/ordon/ordon-a.md) and [Ordon B](../place/planet/ordon/ordon-b.md). The days of the week, in order, are:

- Sun Day, which is traditionally a day of rest. The solstices and equinoxes all fall on Sun Days.
- Moon Day, which is traditionally a day of rest, but only pastoral or remote cultures follow this tradition anymore. Also, Dunfoyn doesn't have a moon, which is why people don't respect is a day of rest anymore.
- Dues Day, a work day to pay off debts.
- Winds Day, a work day of good fortunes.
- Turns Day, a work day of making significant changes in your life. 
- Fest Day, a work day of revelry.
- Star Day, which is traditionally a day of rest. Holidays that fall on Star Days tend to be reflective and quiet rather than celebratory.

### Hours

There are 24 hours per day. Each hour is 60 minutes long. Local noon is 12:00 and local midnight is 0:00 or 24:00 depending on the local culture.

### Minutes

There are 60 minutes per hour. Each minute is 60 seconds long.

### Seconds

This page lists the different Calendars native to the [Wandering Bastion](../../index.md) campaign setting.

## Aelfaran Calendar

The majority of citizens of [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md) use the calendar originally created by the Elves and Gnomes native to [Aelfar](../place/planet/plaer/aelfar.md) shortly after their arrival at [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md). It is notably extremely accurate in terms of leap dates. Reportedly, humans found that the Aelfaran calendar closely matched the calendars that they used on [[../place/plane/inner/matter/earth]]. 

### Epochs

Each date is based on a specific epoch, defined by the number of years since the event that initiated it. The current epoch is the Epoch of the Last Stand.

- Epoch of Creation
- Epoch of Myth
- Epoch of Many Worlds
- Epoch of the Void
- Epoch of Worlds United
- Epoch of Clashing Deities
- Epoch of Accord
- Epoch of the Last Stand
- Epoch of Prophecy

### Years

Each year is 365.242196 days long

#### Extra Days & Leap Years

Each year, there is 1 extra day on the winter solstice that is not associated with any given week or month. On leap years, there is an additional extra day on the spring equinox. Leap years occur every year divisible by 4 but not on years divisible by 128 or 4996.

### Months

There are 4 months per year, one for each season, separated at the solstices and equinoxes. Each month is 13 weeks or 91 days long. In reality, seasons are irregular across [Dunfoyn](../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md), as its orbit is oblique and elliptical and its axis of rotation is at a high angle.

### Weeks

There are 13 weeks per month. Each week is 7 days long. The length of the week was chosen because 91, the number of days in a month, only has the factors 1, 7, 13, and 91. 7 was preferred over 13 because 7 was 

### Days

Alignment in the [Wandering Bastion](../../index.md) campaign setting is usually split into 25 different alignments. These alignments are as described in [this post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlignmentCharts/comments/q8o93g/a_less_specific_and_broader_5x5_alignment_chart/). Each alignment is associated with a specific plane in the [Outer Planes](../place/plane/outer/index.md)

This image depicts an 'Alignment Chart' showing the 25 different alignments.

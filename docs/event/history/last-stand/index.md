The Epoch of the Last Stand is the current epoch of the [Aelfaran Calendar](../../calendar.md#aelfaran-calendar), the main [Calendar](../../calendar.md) of the  [Wandering Bastion Campaign Setting](../../../index.md). This epoch started with the [Ifvra Party Encounter](ifvra-party-encounter.md). The Epoch of the Last Stand is destined to end when the [Prophecy of Shattered Reality](../../../concept/prophecy/shattered-reality.md) comes to pass, at some point in the future.

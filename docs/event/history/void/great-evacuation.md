The Great Evacuation is when the remainder of life in the [Material Plane](../../../place/plane/prime/material.md), on the [Five Lost Planets](../../../place/planet/5-lost-planets.md) collectively escaped to [Dunfoyn](../../../place/planet/ordon/dunfoyn.md) through the [Five Errant Gates](../../../object/magic-items/5-errant-gates.md) to avoid the [Aberrant Horde](../../../creature/species/aberration/index.md).

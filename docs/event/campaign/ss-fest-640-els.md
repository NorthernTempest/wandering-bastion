This [Sunspark Festival](../recurring/holiday/sunspark-festival.md) marked the beginning of the campaign. The player characters of the [Cracked Facade](../../cracked-facade/index.md) campaign initially gathered and met here. Some came to attend the festival, some came to meet with family, and some arrived here by other means.

Here is a choice list of events that occurred at the festival:

- [Pilgrim Grum](../../creature/unique/pc/cracked-facade/pilgrim-grum.md) met [Father Peter Freitag](../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) on their way to the festival.
- [Father Peter Freitag](../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) instructed [Pilgrim Grum](../../creature/unique/pc/cracked-facade/pilgrim-grum.md) to find lodging at [L'Arc Petite](../../place/state/wounded-coast/arsleaf/ybbrinth/larc-petite.md).
- [Pilgrim Grum](../../creature/unique/pc/cracked-facade/pilgrim-grum.md) visited [L'Arc Petite](../../place/state/wounded-coast/arsleaf/ybbrinth/larc-petite.md) and rented a room there from [Ilske Dietingen](../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/dietingen-ilske.md).

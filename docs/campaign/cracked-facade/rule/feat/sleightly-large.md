**Prerequisite**: Large size category

You can pass through doors and passages sized for medium sized creatures without squeezing and you're unusually stealthy for your size.

- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you attempt to grapple someone while they are unaware of you, if you succeed on the grapple check, you do not break out of stealth and they cannot speak clearly or make noises louder than a whisper.
- Without squeezing, you can move through and stop in a space large enough for a Small creature.

Street Smarts. While in a city or other urban environment, you have advantage on ability checks made to avoid getting lost and checks made to find a particular kind of business or other destination open to the public. Additionally, while you are in such environments, you canâ€™t be surprised unless you are asleep or otherwise incapacitated.

Escape Tactics. If you are grappled and you have the option to attempt to escape the grapple as an action, you may, instead, attempt to escape the grapple as a bonus action.

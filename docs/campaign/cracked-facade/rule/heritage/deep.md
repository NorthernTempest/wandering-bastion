Aberrant Psionics. Choose one of the following abilities:
- You learn a cantrip of your choice from the wizard or sorcerer spell list. This cantrip has no verbal or somatic component for you. At level 3, you learn the spell Detect Thoughts and can cast it without spending a spell slot or using verbal or somatic components. Once you cast Detect Thoughts in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
- You can send telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You donâ€™t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to comprehend them.

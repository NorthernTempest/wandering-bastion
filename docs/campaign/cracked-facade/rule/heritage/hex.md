You came from a region where hexes are used as an everyday magical tool.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Intelligence or Charisma.

**Languages**. You know Common, Sylvan, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Arcana or Deception.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Poisoner's Kits or Disguise Kits.

**Hexworked**. You are resistant to one of psychic, sonic, or necrotic damage.

**Minor Curses**. Choose a Cantrip from either the school of Enchantment or the school of Necromancy. You learn that Cantrip. At levels 3 and 5, you learn a 1st or 2nd level spell from either of those same schools. You can cast both spells once without expending a spell slot and without having to use any material components. Once you cast one of these spells in that way, you cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.

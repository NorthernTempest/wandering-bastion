You were raised in a water-side community of fisher people and divers.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Constitution or Wisdom.

**Languages**. You know Common, Ancient, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Athletics or Survival.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Vehicles (Water) or one set of Artisan's Tools.

**Trained Diver**. You can hold your breath for four times as long as normal and can choose to breath more slowly to count as one quarter of a person when calculating how long you can survive in an enclosed space with a limited amount of air.  You do not take disadvantage on underwater attack rolls with weapons that you are proficient in.

**Seaside Weapon Proficiency**. You gain proficiency in crossbows, daggers, darts, javelins, nets, shortswords, spears, and tridents.

**Heave-Ho**. You can pull a creature closer to you by spending one of your attacks. Make a Strength (Athletics) check against a DC equal to the Strength score of the creature you are targeting. On a success, the creature is not grappled. Instead, it moves to occupy the square adjacent to you that was closest to the centre of its space. The square of the creature's space that occupies the adjacent square is the one that was closest to you. In order to take this action, you must either
- be within the reach of at least one of the target's attacks.
- Have hit the target with a weapon that does piercing damage tied to a piece of rope at least as long as the distance between you and the target. If the weapon has the ammunition property, the piece of ammunition must be tied to the piece of rope. If the weapon does not have the ammunition property, the weapon must be tied to the piece of rope and you must have let go of it after your last attack with it. If the target has healed 1 or more hit points or used an action to remove the weapon or ammunition from it, you cannot use it to perform this grappling option.
- Have a grappling hook tied to a piece of rope at least as long as the distance between you and the target.

**Tie Down**. As a bonus action, you can tie a creature to a spot on the ground as long as you have successfully used Heave-Ho on it. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check and pick the corner of a square within your reach. The center of the target's space cannot move farther from that point than it is when you tie them down. As an action, the tied down creature makes an Intelligence check with a DC equal to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check.

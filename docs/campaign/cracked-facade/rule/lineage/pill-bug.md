Traits:

- Rolled Up. You can roll into your hardened shell to retreat from battle as an action. While in your shell, you cannot make attacks (other than a Rolling Attack detailed below) or cast spells, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and gain a bonus to your walking speed equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you. You come out of your shell by using a bonus action or when you become unconscious.

- Natural Protection. You cannot wear regular armor due to your large size and strange physique. Your shell does provide you with natural armor, however. Your AC is equal to 13 + your Constitution modifier A shieldâ€™s benefits apply as normal while you use this natural armor.

- Rolling Attack. This attack can only be used while you are in your shell. As an action, you can move up to 10 feet in a straight line towards your target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw equal to 8 + your your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be knocked prone. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and half as much on a success. The damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 16th level.

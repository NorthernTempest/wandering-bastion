Traits:

- Relentless Fortitude: You do not fall unconscious when you have 0 remaining hit points. When you have 0 hit points, you are still dying and must still make death saving throws as normal. As normal, you remove all death saving throws when you are healed, you gain a failed death saving throw when you would take damage, and critical hits against you deal two failed death saving throws. Because you aren't unconscious, melee attacks do not automatically count as critical hits, and you are still able to take actions as normal. You may stay conscious after dropping to 0 hit points a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses of this ability after a long rest.
- Savage attacks: Whenever you deal critical damage, it does an additional amount of damage equal to that of a normal hit. That means that if you would normally do 2d6+5 damage on a hit, you instead deal 6d6+10 damage.
- Irregular Sustenance: You may go up to 4 whole days without food, water, or sleep without taking any penalties from starvation, dehydration, or sleep-deprivation, but after 4 long rests without making up for this missed sustenance, you take a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the number of days of food missed all at once. In order to end your starvation after missing one or more days of sleep, food, and or water, you must eat that many days of food, drink that many days worth of water, and or sleep for 8 consecutive hours of sleep for each day's worth of missed sleep in addition to the amount you need to survive for that day. If you do so before you are exhausted on the 5th day, you do not receive exhaustion, and if you do so after you've received the exhaustion, you recover all your levels of exhaustion. You cannot recover from any exhaustion until you've made up for the food you've already skipped, except through the use of the spells Greater Restoration, Heal, or Wish. These amounts are cumulative over time and cannot be recuperated from separately. If you miss one day of food, that day of food must be made up for before the end of the fourth day. If you miss all 4 days of food, you must make up for all four days worth of food all at once before the end of the 4th day after the first day you missed. As a counter example, you couldn't skip a meal on the first, second, and third days and then prevent your exhaustion by eating only two days' worth of food on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days. You would have to eat 4 day's worth of food on the 4th day or you would gain 3 levels of exhaustion at the start of the 5th day. If you need to eat, drink, or sleep for longer than a whole day, then you can count the day that you started eating, drinking, or sleeping as the day that you recovered from that kind of sustenance deprivation. TL;DR: skip eating, sleeping, and drinking on days 1, 2, and 3, but eat 4 times as much on day 4 or else 4 exhaustion.

## Character Creation and Character Options

This section of the document describes rules related to creating and advancing a player character.

### Starting Level

We'll be starting the campaign at level 1

### Classes

- Homebrew and third-party classes are permitted on a case by case basis.

### Races

Pick one of each of the following:

- [Heritage](heritage/index.md)
- [Lineage](lineage/index.md)

These rules are heavily inspired by [Tales of the Valiant Alpha Release by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tales-of-the-valiant-alpha-release-pdf/).

Normally, you should refer to your race as <Heritage\> <Lineage\>. Eg. City Elf, Grove Tiefling, or Nomad Halfling.

### Background

- Any background that did not already grant a feat will allow the player to choose a *flavourful* feat.

### Ability Scores

- Roll 2d4+10 for 3 different ability scores. Roll 2d4+3 for 2 ability scores. 17 is the remaining score.
- Add the modifier from your lineage to your ability scores.
- Add the modifier from your heritage to your ability scores.
- Add +2 to one ability score of your choice, other than any ability score modified by your lineage or heritage.

### Proficiencies

Small or smaller creatures gain +2 to stealth for each category smaller than Medium. Large or larger creatures take -2 to stealth for each category larger than Medium.
In addition to the proficiencies you receive from your class and background, you gain additional proficiencies based on your intelligence score. Each of these proficiencies are chosen by you freely from the category of proficiencies granted. Eg. languages, tools, or skills.

| Intelligence Score | Additional Proficiencies                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| < 8                | Inability to read any language                                                             |
| 8 - 11             | -                                                                                          |
| 12 - 13            | Proficiency with one additional language                                                   |
| 14 - 15            | Proficiency with one additional language and one additional tool                           |
| 16 - 17            | Proficiency with one additional language, one additional tool, and one additional skill    |
| 18 - 19            | Proficiency with two additional languages, one additional tool, and one additional skill   |
| 20 - 21            | Proficiency with two additional languages, two additional tools, and one additional skill  |
| > 21               | Proficiency with two additional languages, two additional tools, and two additional skills |

### Equipment

- We will be using [Sane Magical Prices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8XAiXpOfz9cMWt1RTBicmpmUDg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-ceHUken0_UhQ3Apa6g4SJA) to determine magic item pricing.

### Character Description

#### Backstory

- Should be no less than 3 paragraphs.
- Should be no more than 7 paragraphs. Feel free to write more, just don't expect me to remember it.
- Free feat of your choice upon submission.
- In order to help the player characters naturally form into a cohesive party, include how your character established a strong relationship with one of the following:
	- Another player character
	- L'Arc Chantante, a remarkably tall and world famous cathedral dedicated to the goddess Arcundus, located a few days from the eastern coast of the [Great Alliance of the Wounded Coast](../../../lore/place/nation/great-alliance.md)
	- The nearby town #TODO
	- The goddess Arcundus (ark-OOND-ous), a deity of the Sun, the Moon, architecture, and the movement of celestial bodies, or the pantheon of deities that she allies herself with.
	- One or more of the staff at the cathedral. For example:
		- Mother Wilhelmina of the Order of the Ellipses, beloved leader of the #TODO
		- Acolyte Jensen, a minor noble from a nearby coastal city-state who had to run away from some trouble he was facing 
		- #TODO
- Come up with a reason why your character ends up staying at L'Arc Chantante the night before the festival. Some example reasons could be:
	- Your character works at the cathedral as an acolyte, janitor, hunter, healer, or even a salesperson trying to hawk wares. A church as massive and famous as this one is a centre of commerce by it's very nature.
	- You are poor enough or ill enough to need to find solace there.
	- #TODO 
### Joining After Level 1

- Any character that joins the campaign at a level higher than 1 will be granted a budget for purchasing items and may purchase items from the Sane Magical Prices document (see [Equipment](#equipment))

## Character Creation and Character Options

This section of the document describes rules related to creating and advancing a player character.

### Starting Level

We'll be starting the campaign at level 1

### Classes

- Homebrew and third-party classes are permitted on a case by case basis.

### Races

Pick one of each of the following:

- [Heritage](heritage/index.md)
- [Lineage](lineage/index.md)

These rules are heavily inspired by [Tales of the Valiant Alpha Release by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tales-of-the-valiant-alpha-release-pdf/).

Normally, you should refer to your race as <Heritage\> <Lineage\>. Eg. City Elf, Grove Tiefling, or Nomad Halfling.

### Background

- Any background that did not already grant a feat will allow the player to choose a *flavourful* feat.

### Ability Scores

- Roll 2d4+10 for 3 different ability scores. Roll 2d4+3 for 2 ability scores. 17 is the remaining score.
- Add the modifier from your lineage to your ability scores.
- Add the modifier from your heritage to your ability scores.
- Add +2 to one ability score of your choice, other than any ability score modified by your lineage or heritage.

### Proficiencies

Small or smaller creatures gain +2 to stealth for each category smaller than Medium. Large or larger creatures take -2 to stealth for each category larger than Medium.
In addition to the proficiencies you receive from your class and background, you gain additional proficiencies based on your intelligence score. Each of these proficiencies are chosen by you freely from the category of proficiencies granted. Eg. languages, tools, or skills.

| Intelligence Score | Additional Proficiencies                                                                   |

| 8 - 11             | -                                                                                          |
| 12 - 13            | Proficiency with one additional language                                                   |

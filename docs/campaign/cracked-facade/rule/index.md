[<- Back to A Cracked Facade](../index.md)

This document is where rules are recorded for the D&D 5e campaign A Cracked Facade that takes place in the Wandering Bastion campaign setting. Any rules are subject to change as we figure things out.

## [Character Creation](./character-creation.md)

These rules describe how to create a character for the campaign. They've been moved to a separate document because they make up the majority of rulings

## Homebrew

These rules are homebrew rules that alter the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons 5e for this campaign.

### Magic

These rules describe changes to spellcasting and spells.

#### Concentration

A spellcaster can concentrate on a number of spells equal to their proficiency bonus. For every spell the caster is concentrating on beyond the first, the DC for concentration checks goes up by 1.

### Exploration

#### Short Rests

A short rest takes 10 minutes. During this rest, you are occupied with casting minor healing magics and rituals, eating, cleaning and dressing wounds, and using minor magic items to recover. Your characters always have the tools with them that they need to perform these tasks. While taking a short rest, you must use your action to perform these minor tasks. If, during your short rest and before the end of the 10 minute duration, you (a) lose 1 or more hit points, or (b) use an ability or spell with a limited number of uses, you lose all progress towards your short rest and must start a new short rest to gain the benefits of one.

## Game Rulings

This section of the document will be filled in whenever we run into something that causes issues.

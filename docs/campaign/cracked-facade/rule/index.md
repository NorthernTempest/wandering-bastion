This document is where rules are recorded for the D&D 5e campaign A Cracked Facade that takes place in the Wandering Bastion campaign setting.

## Character Creation and Character Options

This section of the document describes rules related to creating and advancing a player character.

### Classes

- Homebrew and third-party classes are permitted on a case by case basis.

### Races

Pick a [Heritage](heritage/index.md) and a [Lineage](lineage/index.md), as heavily inspired by [Tales of the Valiant Alpha Release by Kobold Press](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tales-of-the-valiant-alpha-release-pdf/). Normally, you should refer to your race as \<Heritage\> \<Lineage\>. Eg. City Elf, Grove Tiefling, or Nomad Halfling.

### Background

### Ability Scores

- Roll 2d4+10 for 3 different ability scores. Roll 2d4+3 for 2 ability scores. 17 is the remaining score.
- Add the modifier from your lineage to your ability scores.
- Add the modifier from your heritage to your ability scores.
- Add +2 to one ability score of your choice, other than any ability score modified by your lineage or heritage.

### Proficiencies

Small or smaller creatures gain +2 to stealth for each category smaller than Medium. Large or larger creatures take -2 to stealth for each category larger than Medium.
In addition to the proficiencies you receive from your class and background, you gain additional proficiencies based on your intelligence score. Each of these proficiencies are chosen by you freely from the category of proficiencies granted. Eg. languages, tools, or skills.

## Homebrew

### Magic

### Resting

A short rest takes 10 minutes. During this rest, you are occupied with casting minor healing magics and rituals, eating, cleaning and dressing wounds, and using minor magic items to recover. Your characters always have the tools with them that they need to perform these tasks. While taking a short rest, you must use your action to perform these minor tasks. If, during your short rest and before the end of the 10 minute duration, you (a) lose 1 or more hit points, or (b) use an ability or spell with a limited number of uses, you lose all progress towards your short rest and must start a new short rest to gain the benefits of one.

This page lists any changes to core game mechanics. Any character creation or advancement options are listed in [Character Creation Rules](character-creation.md)

### Magic

These rules describe changes to spellcasting and spells.

#### Concentration

A spellcaster can concentrate on a number of spells equal to their proficiency bonus. For every spell the caster is concentrating on beyond the first, the DC for concentration checks goes up by 1.

### Exploration

#### Short Rests

A short rest takes 10 minutes. During this rest, you are occupied with casting minor healing magics and rituals, eating, cleaning and dressing wounds, and using minor magic items to recover. Your characters always have the tools with them that they need to perform these tasks. While taking a short rest, you must use your action to perform these minor tasks. If, during your short rest and before the end of the 10 minute duration, you (a) lose 1 or more hit points, or (b) use an ability or spell with a limited number of uses, you lose all progress towards your short rest and must start a new short rest to gain the benefits of one.

- Draconic Resistance: You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.
- Breath Weapon: When you take the attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a saving throw, as listed in your draconic ancestry, with a DC of 8 + the higher of your Constitution or Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of the type listed in your Draconic Ancestry. This damage increases by 1d6 every odd level. The radius of your breath weapon increases by 5 feet at 5th level and every 5 levels afterwards. Beginning at level 8, whenever a creature saves against your Breath Weapon, they still take half damage. You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
- Draconic Revelation: You gain one of the following abilities, as listed in your Draconic Ancestry. The DC for any abilities that require a saving throw is the same as for your Breath Weapon.
	- Chromatic Immunity: As a reaction that you take when you would take the type of damage listed in your Draconic Ancestry, you become immune to the damage type listed in your Draconic Ancestry until the end of your next turn.
	- Gem Psionics: You gain the following two abilities:
		- You can send telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to comprehend them.
		- Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
	- Metallic Shout: At level 5, your breath weapon becomes more powerful. Each time that you use your breath weapon, choose one of the following four effects to occur in the area of your breath weapon.
		- Annihilating Breath. The DC for your Breath Weapon ability increases by 2. The damage your breath weapon does increases by 3d6.
		- Enervating Breath. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
		- Repulsion Breath. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.

Traits:

- Trance: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

		- Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.
		- You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other partially obscuring natural phenomena.
		- You can detect the presence of invisible creatures or objects within 5 feet of you. You cannot see the invisible creatures or objects, and they still count as invisible to you. You can only identify the 5 foot square that they occupy and how many 5 foot increments above the ground they are
	- Fey Transposition: You gain the following abilities:
		- You know the spell Misty Step, and you can cast Misty Step once per short or long rest without expending a spell slot
		- Each time you cast Misty Step, choose one of the following effects to modify that casting of Misty Step. If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw is based on your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (chosen when you take this lineage)
			- One willing creature that you are touching is teleported instead of you
			- Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of your destination must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
			- Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of your destination must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you
			- Each creature of your choice within 5 feet of your destination takes your chosen ability's (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) modifier in damage

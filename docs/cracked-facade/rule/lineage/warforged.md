Traits:

- Constructed Resilience: You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:
	- You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
	- You are immune to the poisoned condition, poison damage, and disease.
	- You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
- Sentry's Rest: When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.
- Integrated Protection: Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:
	- You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
	- You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 10 minutes, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while wearing, donning, or doffing armor in this way.
	- While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can’t be removed against your will.
- Rust Vulnerability: attacks that cause weapons or armor to become damaged due to rust or other metal corrosion, such as the Rust Monster's Antennae action, inflict 2d6 damage + the highest ability modifier of the monster that inflicted the damage
- Forged with a Purpose: you are a weapon built for combat:
	- You can equip one weapon in such a way that you cannot drop it. To equip a weapon in this way, you must incorporate it into your arm over the course of 10 minutes. You cannot be disarmed of any weapon equipped in this way. You cannot drop or sheathe any weapon equipped this way. You cannot handle anything else with that hand while you have any weapon equipped this way. You can equip any weapon you are proficient in in this way, even weapons that would normally be wielded in two hands, and you may hold any one-handed or light weapon in your other hand and may make off-hand attacks normally with the other weapon.
	- Pick one of the following additional features at character creation:
		- Mechanical Mage: You have a flamethrower in your mouth. As a bonus action, you may make a breath attack in a 15' cone in front of you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + the higher of your Constitution or Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of the type listed in your Draconic Ancestry and on a successful save, they take half of that amount. This damage increases by 1d6 every odd level. The radius of your breath weapon increases by 5 feet at 5th level and every 5 levels afterwards. You can use your flamethrower a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
		- Unconventional Weaponry: You have horns, a spiked tail, or blades can appear out of the tips of your feet. Once per turn, when you take the attack action, you can make one additional attack with this attached weapon. You are proficient with this attack and can attack with either Strength or Dexterity. If you hit, this weapon does 1d6 damage. You do not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to this damage.
		- Quick Step: Your walking speed is increased by 5 feet and while you are travelling, you can move stealthily, navigate, draw a map, track, or forage at a normal pace.
		- Tool of Convenience: You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice, one tool of your choice, and fluency in one language of your choice. In addition, choose one tool you're proficient with. This tool is integrated into your body, and you double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks you make with it. You need at least one hand free to use this integrated too.

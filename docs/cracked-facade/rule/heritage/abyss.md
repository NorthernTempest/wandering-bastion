You either come from the outer plane known as the Abyss or the place you come from or people you grew up around had close ties to that destructive and terrifying plane.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Strength or Charisma.

**Languages**. You know Common, Abyssal, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Religion and Deception.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Disguise Kits or a Musical Instrument.

**Demonic Hide**. You are resistant to Fire damage.

**Horrendous Power**. Choose a Cantrip from either the school of Enchantment or the school of Evocation. You learn that Cantrip. At levels 3 and 5, you learn a 1st or 2nd level spell from either of those same schools. You can cast both spells once without expending a spell slot and without having to use any material components. Once you cast one of these spells in that way, you cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.

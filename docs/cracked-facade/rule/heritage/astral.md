You either come from the [Astral Plane](../../../place/plane/transitive/astral.md) or the place you come from or people you grew up around had close ties to that unknowable and strangely familiar plane.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Intelligence or Wisdom.

**Languages**. You know Common, Iconic, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either History or Nature.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Vehicles (Water) or Herbalism Kits.

**Ancestral Knowledge**. After each long rest, choose one skill. Gain proficiency with that skill until the end of your next long rest. Your long rests take half as long as normal.

**Tap the Metaphysical**. Choose a Cantrip from either the school of Conjuration or the school of Transmutation. You learn that Cantrip. At levels 3 and 5, you learn a 1st or 2nd level spell from either of those same schools. You can cast both spells once without expending a spell slot and without having to use any material components. Once you cast one of these spells in that way, you cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.

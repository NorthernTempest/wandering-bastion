You either come from the outer plane known as Axiom or the place you come from or people you grew up around had close ties to that inhuman plane of clockwork and mathematics.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Intelligence or Wisdom.

**Languages**. You know Common, Iconic, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either History or Religion.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Tinker's Tools or a Musical Instrument.

**Legalistic Fortitude**. You are resistant to Psychic damage.

**Horrendous Power**. Choose a Cantrip from either the school of Abjuration or the school of Enchantment. You learn that Cantrip. At levels 3 and 5, you learn a 1st or 2nd level spell from either of those same schools. You can cast both spells once without expending a spell slot and without having to use any material components. Once you cast one of these spells in that way, you cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest.

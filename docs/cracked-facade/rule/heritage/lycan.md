**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Strength or Intelligence.

**Languages**. You know Common, Wild Speech, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Animal Handling or Survival.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Herbalism Kits or Land Vehicles.

**Shift**. As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 × your proficiency bonus. You can shift a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Whenever you shift, you gain an additional benefit based on one of the following options (choose two each time you shift):

- **Beasthide.** You gain 1d6 additional [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints). While shifted, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
- **Longtooth.** When you shift and as a bonus action on your other turns while shifted, you can use your elongated fangs to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with your fangs, you can deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- **Swiftstride.** While shifted, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a reaction when a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This reactive movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).
- **Wildhunt.** While shifted, you have advantage on Wisdom checks, and no creature within 30 feet of you can make an attack roll with advantage against you unless you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

**Nightvision**. Your vision at night is better than that of those of your race. You have darkvision to a distance of 60 ft. If your lineage would grant you darkvision, then the range of that darkvision increases by 30 ft.

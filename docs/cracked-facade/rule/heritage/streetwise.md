**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Dexterity or Intelligence.

**Languages**. You know Common, Ancient, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Arcana or Sleight of Hand.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either one set of Poisoner's Kit or Thieves' Tools.

**Street Smarts**. While in a city or other urban environment, you have advantage on ability checks made to avoid getting lost and checks made to find a particular kind of business or other destination open to the public. Additionally, while you are in such environments, you canâ€™t be surprised unless you are asleep or otherwise incapacitated.

**Caster's Counter**. You have advantage on ability checks made as part of a spell you cast.

Alternatively, replace **Street Smarts** and **Caster's Counter** with the following two abilities:

**Trick Magic**. You've learned a way to feint in magical duels. When you cast a spell and another creature attempts to use Counterspell or a similar effect to prevent it from being cast, you can choose a different spell of the same or a lower level than the counterspelled one. The slot used for the original spell is unspent, the use of Counterspell used against you is wasted, you cast the new spell using a slot of the appropriate level for that spell, and any use of Counterspell or similar effects is ineffective against the new spell. You regain the ability to do this after a short or long rest.

**Street Slip**. You can slip into the crowd completely unnoticed. You have advantage on ability checks to hide behind creatures or go unrecognized in a crowd. In addition, at level 3 you learn the spell Misty Step. You can cast Misty Step with this trait. Once you cast Misty Step with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast Misty Step using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast Misty Step, and end your teleportation within a crowd, you can immediately make a stealth check to become hidden within that crowd.

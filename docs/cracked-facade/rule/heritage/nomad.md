You come from a nomadic community that travels across a range of land, either following a herd of animals or unable to stay in one place due to fear of persecution.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Constitution or Wisdom.

**Languages**. You know Common, Wild Speech, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Athletics or Survival.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either one set of Navigator's Tools or Vehicles (Land).

**Marathon March**. The DC for taking a Forced March (see Player's Handbook - Chapter 8: Adventuring) is 10 lower than normal (DC is 1 for each hour past 8 spent travelling) for you and up to 8 other creatures of your choice.

**Campsite Care**. When taking a long rest, you and up to 8 other creatures of your choice recover two levels of exhaustion instead of one. At level 5 and every 5 levels there after, the number of levels of exhaustion recovered increases by one.

**Adapt and Overcome**. As a reaction that you can take when you take either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you become resistant to that type of damage for the next minute, including for the instance of damage that triggered the reaction. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you take a long or short rest.

You come from a small nature-centric community deep in the wilds.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Constitution or Wisdom.

**Languages**. You know Common, Wild Speech, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Medicine or Nature.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either one set of Artisan's Tools or Herbalism Kits.

**Friend of Fauna**. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. People from grove communities love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.

**Shaman Magic**. Choose a cantrip from the druid spell list. You know that cantrip and can cast it at will. At levels 3 and 5, you learn a 1st or 2nd level spell from either the druid or ranger spell lists. You can cast both spells once without expending a spell slot and without having to use any material components. Once you cast one of these spells in that way, you cannot cast that spell again until you complete a long rest. Your spellcasting ability score for casting that spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (chosen when you gain this ability.)

You grew up in a community openly run by crime lords or the nastier parts of a larger city.

**Ability Scores**. You gain +1 to one of either Dexterity or Intelligence.

**Languages**. You know Common, Dead Speech, and one other language of your choice.

**Skill Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Stealth or Sleight of Hand.

**Tool Proficiency**. You have proficiency in your choice of either Thieves' Tools or Forgery Kits.

**Street Smarts**. While in a city or other urban environment, you have advantage on ability checks made to avoid getting lost and checks made to find a particular kind of business or other destination open to the public. Additionally, while you are in such environments, you canâ€™t be surprised unless you are asleep or otherwise incapacitated.

**Escape Tactics**. If you are grappled and you have the option to attempt to escape the grapple as an action, you may, instead, attempt to escape the grapple as a bonus action.

## Quick Notes

- 

## Pre-Session Notes

- [x] The main event
	 - [x] The party rolls initiative. They have 3 goals:
		 - [x] Lead the people out of the cathedral
			 - DC 13
			 - +2 Str (Athletics), Wis (Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival), Cha
			 - -2 Dex, Int (Investigate)
			 - Successes
				 - 1 - 4: 20(n)% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 3: The party members working on this task are recognized as heroes by the survivors. +2 to lead the people out of the cathedral.
				 - 5: 90% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 6: 95% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 7: 98% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 8: 99% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 9: 100% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. This challenge ends.
			 - Failures:
				 - 1: Jacqueline Sachs, a brown-eyed brunette middle aged mother of two who worked as a manager at the town general store dies when the floor collapses under her and a pew falls on her, crushing her skull. 3% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, Jacqueline provides the party a 20% discount on goods and services purchased at the general store.
				 - 2: Mayor Ibram Woln, a sharp-eyed career politician from Wickerpool dies when one of the chains holding up a chandelier above her snaps. The oil held in the chandelier pours onto her and catches on fire, burning her alive. Wickerpool will hold an election when news of her death reaches the city and Alderman Nuthra Surina will be elected to replace her. 8% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If this fate is avoided, she will personally provide accommodations and protections inside the city of Wickerpool, guaranteeing the safety of the party members regardless of their actions in the city.
				 - 3: Mother Wilhelmina, a heavy-set and eternally cheerful leader of the monastery is found dead, having passed away due to smoke inhalation. Her ash-and-char-coated corpse will later be extricated from the rubble and she will become venerated as a martyr and a saint. Parts of her body and belongings will be cut up and passed around the world as holy relics. In the aftermath of the fire, the monastic order of the arches disbands. It will take 4 years before another organization takes control of L'Arc Chantante if it still stands. 15% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, she will provide housing to the party in the monastery dorms.
				 - 4: Huntmaster Stanislav, a tall broad shouldered man known for his feats of adventuring prowess and great strength dies when a pair of Efreeti trap him between two Walls of Fire and burn him alive. The survivors' and townsfolk's opinion of the party sours. While within the town or while talking to someone related to a victim of the fire, party members have a 50% chance of taking disadvantage on Cha (Persuasion, Bluff) checks except to convince those people that a party member has performed an evil deed. 25% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, Stanislav will later grant each member of the party lifetime membership to his guild.
				 - 5+: An additional 10% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
			 - Turns:
				 - 1 - 6: Minimum 7n% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 2: Someone panics, and people start pushing and rushing for the doors. -2 to all ability checks other than Cha, until a successful Cha check. 
				 - 4+: Smoke inhalation is becoming a severe problem for those who haven't escaped the fire. -2 to all checks other than Wis (Medicine), but +2 to Wis (Medicine) until the end of the challenge.
				 - 6: The exits have collapsed. -4 to any check that isn't Str (Athletics) until the next success.
		 - [x] Investigate the cause of the fire before the culprits escape
			 - DC 15
			 - +2 Dex (Stealth, Acrobatics), Int (Investigation), Wis (Perception), Cha (Deception, Persuasion)
			 - -2 Str, Cha (Intimidate)
			 - Successes:
				 - 1: Hooded figures were seen gathering near the abandoned dorms, but disappeared before 11:00.
				 - 2: [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) went to investigate the sighting shortly before the figures disappeared, and didn't reappear until 11:55.
				 - 3: There's evidence of a scroll of Gate having been used to call the elementals from the Plane of Fire. It was cast moments before the fire was first spotted.
				 - 4: The caster who caused the fire doesn't breath or bleed and they don't experience pain. A DC 10 Int (Religion) check confirms that the caster must be undead.
				 - 5: The caster appears to have been in a state of panic as they cast the spell.
				 - 6: The caster appears to be a male human and someone of high social standing. You have a rendering of their footprints to compare against if you gain access to a suspects' footwear. This skill challenge ends.
			 - Failures:
				 - 1: An essential clue is overlooked. -2 to future checks to investigate the cause.
				 - 2: A key witness is found dead. -4 to future checks to investigate the cause.
				 - 3: You follow a red herring, wasting time. The party member that triggered this failure misses their next turn.
				 - 4: You've lost the trail. This skill challenge ends.
			 - Turns:
				 - 0: The occupants of the cathedral are somewhat unafraid. Their gossip makes the investigation easier. Ignore failures until the next turn event.
				 - 1 - 3: Panic has beset the occupants of the cathedral, Int (Investigation), Wis (Perception), and Cha (Deception, Persuasion) checks take a -2 penalty, but Dex (Stealth) gains a +2 bonus until the next turn event.
				 - 3+: Clues burn away into smoke and ash. 50% chance each turn to gain a failure.
				 - 4+: Smoke inhalation is becoming a severe problem for those who haven't escaped the fire. -2 to all checks until the end of the challenge.
		 - [x] Minimize the damage
			 - DC 15
			 - +2 Con (Athletics), Cha (Persuasion), Int (Investigation), Wis (Survival)
			 - -3 Dex, Wis (Perception), Cha (Deception)
			 - Successes:
				 - 1 - 19: The fire can be fought. The people are encouraged. +1 to checks to lead the people out of the cathedral.
				 - 3 - (8n-5) - 19: Elementals approach the party. 1d3-1 magmins, 20% chance of a smoke mephit, and 1d4-2 magma mephits. Stop the challenge to fight the elementals.
				 - 20: The fire is out. End the 'Lead the people out of the cathedral' skill challenge and enact all remaining success events in that challenge.
			 - Failures:
				 - 0: The cathedral will be repaired over the next few decades. The party cannot identify the Themesian gate from the burned building.
				 - 1: The cathedral can be rebuilt, but it will take a century or more. *The party does not automatically identify the Themesian gate from the remains of the building and the DC to do so during the investigation is DC 20.*
				 - 3: The cathedral will never be rebuilt, *but the charred ruins hide the Themesian gate from the party. The DC to identify the gate during the investigation is DC 16. End the 'Investigate the cause of the fire before the culprits escape' skill challenge.*
				 - 5: The cathedral will never be rebuilt. The outline of the Themesian gate is one of the more obvious remaining standing structures. At this point, have the party make a DC 14 Int (History) check to recall the [Five Errant Gates](../../../item/magic/5-errant-gates.md) and identify this as one of them. The cathedral collapses. End the 'Lead the people out of the cathedral' skill challenge and enact all remaining failure events in that challenge.
				 - 7: The cathedral has been burned to little more than ashes. The Themesian gate is the one thing that remains standing. At this point, have the party make a DC 12 Int (History) check to recall the [Five Errant Gates](../../../item/magic/5-errant-gates.md) and identify this as one of them.
			 - Turns (init 10):
				 - 3: The flames have spread. -2 to checks to lead the people out of the Cathedral. Mark one failure on this challenge.
				 - 4: The flames have spread. -2 to checks to investigate the cause of the fire.
				 - 5: The flames have spread. -2 to checks to lead the people out of the Cathedral. Mark one failure on this challenge.
				 - 6: The flames have spread. -2 to checks to investigate the cause of the fire.
				 - 7+: The flames have spread. -2 to checks to lead the people out of the Cathedral. Mark one failure on this challenge.
- [x] Omens
	- [x] DC 17 Wis (Perception) check. There's an unusually clean looking woman silently casting a spell in the shadow of one of the buttresses.
	- [x] DC 12 Wis (Perception) check. Person with highest result notices first:
	- [x] A meteor is falling from the sky.
	- [x] The meteor shatters 3k-4k ft above the party.
	- [x] Snow falls down around them, and clouds form in the sky.
	- [x] Grum sees their parents in the sky, and they seem to be smiling at him, shaking their heads and telling Grum not to come for them.
	- [x] Io sees a larger chunk of ice shoot towards a statue of an imposing angelic woman. As it shatters to pieces, he recognizes the woman as Ylissa of the Gnostic Order.
	- [x] Mehen sees one chunk of stone fall off the meteorite and come straight at him. He dodges out of its way, and doesn't feel injured, but when he looks at his contract, it is oozing blood and acid as a hole is torn through it. It slowly stitches itself back together, fibre by fibre.
	- [x] Mr. Sacks sees the paved road he stands on get hit by a blade of ice, splitting it in two.
- [x] Level up and ask the party for their passive perception and passive insight.
- [x] Post fire - Players choose what to do next:
	- Attempt to go directly to [Wickerpool](../../../place/state/wounded-coast/arsleaf/wickerpool.md).
		1. Stopped at the border of town by [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md).
		2. He asks them to help him investigate the cause of the fire.
		3. He suspects that the fire was related to the ritual that the party mentioned the other day.
		4. He's worried about the potential of another attack and has deep respect for the party after the fire.
		5. If the party don't relent, and leave town, after a day's travel, they'll find that fog surrounds the county border and has trapped them inside. In truth, the fog is there as an investigative measure, set up by the Earl. Little does he know that the leaders of the cult who were present before the fire left once the Earl discovered their ritual.
	- Investigate the cause of the fire.
		- Investigate the church ruins
			- DC to identify the gate from the ruins found in the 'Failures' section of the 'Minimize the damage' skill challenge.
		- Investigate [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md).
			- Talk with him
				- If the party comes with Mother Wilhelmina, she'll indicate that the party knows. The Earl will relax in his seat, as if a weight has been taken off his shoulders. He immediately assumes that the party is to be trusted.
				- Confront him with the evidence of his vampirism or involvement with the fire.
					- The Earl is initially and obviously surprised, but calms down quickly if given the chance. He has no interest in killing the town's heroes, regardless of whether they intend to kill him or not.
				- Hide their suspicions
					- The Earl is an insightful creature. He infers that the party are suspicious of him. He'll ask them why they're acting suspicious.
					- If they confront him about being a vampire or his involvement with the fire, he'll acknowledge the claims and offer to explain
				- Attack him
					- If the party attack him, he'll first try to retreat to a room of the house with no sunlight. He's not a violent man except to unreasonable monsters. If they persist their attack, he'll try to explain that he's not a monster, and that he's trying to fulfill his duty to Arcundus.
				- Ultimately, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) decides to trust the players unless they continue to try to kill him after he finishes his explanation, threaten the townspeople, or attempt to share the information with the town.
					- If they seriously attempt to kill him, he'll attempt to dominate one of them, using that party member as a bargaining chip until the dungeon is explored.
					- If they threaten the townspeople, his opinion of them immediately sours. The Earl tolerates no harm to his citizens. He initially hesitates at violence, but immediately threatens harm to them in turn. He'll stand up and prepare to fight, but will be stopped by [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) coming into the room. He'll beg the Earl and the party to stand down. There's been a huge misunderstanding. He offers to bring 
					- If they attempt to inform the townspeople, or anyone from out of town, he'll attempt to capture them without harming them.
					- Otherwise, he'll answer any questions that the party have for him, with input from [Mother Wilhelmina Yrstrone](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/yrstrone-wilhelmina.md) and [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md), if they're present. He'll then ask the party for a favour. He wants to investigate the [Abandoned Dormitories of the Monastery of the Arches](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/abandoned-monastery-dorms.md) with them.
				- If they ask him where he learned about the cultist ritual, he'll explain that he's captured two cultists (the ones the party had encountered at breakfast earlier that day) and interrogated them. He had to start the fire in order to force the townsfolk out before the ritual was completed. He's hesitant to explain why the ritual was so dangerous unless the party indicate they learned about the [Errant Gate](../../../item/magic/5-errant-gates.md) built into [L'Arc Chantante](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/larc-chantante.md). If they do know about the gate, he'll explain that the ritual is used to unlock the gate.
			- Sneak around his property
				- They're quickly spotted by the Earl. He asks the party to join him in his sitting room. They're free to confront him or leave.
			- Ask around town about him
				- [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md)
					- Says that he's worried about the Earl who he hasn't seen since after the fire.
					- If asked why they're arguing, he says that it's a town issue, and doesn't want to bother them.
					- If presented with the evidence they've collected about the Earl at the fire, [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md) looks very surprised. Although he's somewhat trusting of the Earl, he's had a few questions circling his head for the last decade or so.
						- [ ] [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) has always seemed about the same age, despite having known him for just over 3 decades.
						- [ ] No one in town or at the church ever met his father, who was a recluse.
						- [ ] The few times that [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md) touched [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md), his skin felt very cold. He wears heavy suits even in the hottest parts of summer.
						- [ ] [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md) was attacked by a young red dragon when he was a teenager and [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) was the one who saved him, which led Stan to his profession later in life. Despite [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md)'s first impression of him, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) is ***very*** strong and more than capable in a fight.
						- [ ] He concludes, as the players may have, that the Earl is hiding the fact that he's undead.
						- [ ] [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md) says that, despite the fact that he's been hiding his nature, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) has always worked in the interest of the people and no one ever goes missing in the county.
						- Stanislav hides the fact that he's planned a secret meeting with the Earl.
						- Having realized that the Earl is a vampire and that he still trusts him, when he confronts him at the secret meeting and the secret comes out, he won't fight back and the issue won't escalate beyond Stan getting punched once. This saves Stan's life.
				- [Ilske Dietingen](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/dietingen-ilske.md)
					- Says that she's happy with the Earl's policies.
						- He's the one that pays for the free healthcare in town by providing food and building maintenance for the church.
						- He implemented a policy that employs anyone looking for a job.
						- Criminals, with few exceptions, are given education and rehabilitation. Only the most dangerous criminals are incarcerated.
					- If pressed for negative info about the Earl, she gets defensive of him, suggesting that the party are journalists looking for fake news.
						- Her reason: her older sister had an unrequited crush on him a decade or so ago, and although things got complicated, he let her down very gently. [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) has always been a perfect gentleman, even when personally offended or attacked. In truth, he sees [Ilske Dietingen](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/dietingen-ilske.md) as a confidant in looking after the town, although he shares nothing about his duties guarding the gate.
						- If the party presses her further, even if they show her evidence, she asks the party to leave. [Pilgrim Grum](../../../creature/unique/pc/cracked-facade/pilgrim-grum.md) is still welcome to his room, but she asks that he brings requests to one of her employees in the future, rather than herself. This can be reversed if the party passes a DC 15 Cha (Persuasion) check, apologize, and mention their actions during the fire. 
						- If the party relents and apologizes instead, she lightens up and thinks better of the party for it. She asks them to help guard the Inn. See the Guard the Inn task below.
				- [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md)
					- Says that the Earl has been nothing but kind to the [Ybbrinth Church](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/ybbrinth-church.md) and the town's inhabitants.
					- If pressed, Peter suggests that the prosperity of the town, the safety of its citizens, and the happiness of his flock are ample evidence of the Earl's kind heart.
					- If presented with evidence that the Earl is a vampire or that the Earl started the fire at the church, [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) acts nervous.
						- He shushes the party, looks nervously around, and goes to close the door at the front of the church, locking it when he does so.
						- The party don't know it, but they're now treading on very thin ice.
							- [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) is one of two dominated allies of the Earl's, along with a handyman and capable rogue named Ksawery Fedor.
							- Father Peter was once a hardened bandit leader in the mountains, until the Earl came in and took out their bandit camp by himself. Ever since then, he's been mentally dominated and forced to work for the good of the town.
							- In truth, over the years, Peter not only grew accustomed to life as a priest and secret agent of the Earl's, but actually grew genuine respect and appreciation for the Earl, the townspeople, the deity he once pretended to worship, and the good work he does. In contrast, he is deeply ashamed of his actions in the distant past and is grateful for a chance of redemption.
							- Although Peter's opinion of the Earl has grown over the years, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) still doesn't know that he's earned the man's loyalty and continues to maintain his charm on the man, only thinking of him as the monster that led bandits to destroy 3 nearby villages and kill 150 or so people for the meagre coins and food they possessed.
							- [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) is a human [Bandit Lord](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#bandit%20lord_tob1-2023) but isn't currently armed. His goal is now to arm himself in case he needs to silence the party. His weapons are stored behind a false back in the cupboard where he stores his cleaning supplies in his living quarters. His standing orders are only to attack investigators if they intend harm towards the town, L'Arc Chantante, the Earl, or Peter himself. If he believes that the party aren't hostile, his orders are to bring them directly to the Earl, who is currently at his estate.
						- Check the party's passive insight against DC 14.
							- If successful, he's not looking for anyone who might be listening in. He's only pretending to do that.
							- If they beat the DC by 4, they additionally figure out that he's also obscuring the fact that he purposefully glanced at the rear door that leads to his living quarters as if he's thinking about going there. 
						- [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) asks the party where they learned this.
						- After the party offers an explanation, he asks to be excused to prepare the sitting room and some tea for them.
							- He does do that, if permitted to, but also hides his longsword and dagger under the cushions of his chair. He's practiced at this task, and the DC to spot the longsword is 20, an unlikely feat.
							- If the party ask to leave, he'll have to let them, but he'll later ask Ksawery Fedor to follow them around town to report back to [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md).
							- If the party ask him not to or to talk to them here, he'll move to the other room either way, saying that it's very rude to talk of secrets and important things with guests without providing them  snacks or tea.
							- If the party moves to follow him, he'll allow them to do so and won't be able to hide the longsword and dagger.
							- If the party confront him about his suspicious behaviour, he'll ask them to leave. Later, he'll send Ksawery Fedor to follow them around town to report back to [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md).
							- If the party threaten or intimidate him, cast spells near him (other than non-harmful divine ones), or even indicate that they might draw their weapons, he'll run into his quarters to fetch his weapons.
						- If he has tea with the party, he'll try to determine the party's purpose.
							- If he believes that the party are trying to protect the town, or at least that they don't intend harm, he'll suggest that the party talk with the Earl themselves, even bringing them to his estate himself.
							- If he believes that the party are dangerous, he'll call for help and draw his weapons, if he has them, running to get them if he doesn't.
				- [Mother Wilhelmina Yrstrone](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/yrstrone-wilhelmina.md)
					- Immediately infers that the party is investigating the Earl, but also knows that the party are good intentioned. She suggests that the party talk with the Earl themselves and offers to take them to see him.
					- If they ask, she'll explain to the party that she works with the Earl to protect the gate and/or [L'Arc Chantante](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/larc-chantante.md) (if it still stands)
					- If they refuse, she'll let them go without trouble, only reminding them that she will probably bring them up in conversation with the Earl later on.
				- Anyone else from town:
					- Roll d6
						1. They suggest that the party ask Mother Wilhelmina about the Earl. They've noticed she's friendly with him.
						2. They state that they're very happy with the policies that the Earl offers.
						3. They ask why the party are looking into him. If they are forthright about why, they laugh off the accusations. The say that the Earl's a genuinely good man.
						4. They say that they're too busy to talk right now. (If approached again later, re-roll.)
						5. They say that they've seen the Earl go to [Ybbrinth Church](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/ybbrinth-church.md) and talk with [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md).
						6. They say that the Earl has always been good to the people of the town, even if there are occasional policies that they disagree with.
				- Anyone from out of town will say that they aren't familiar with the Earl, but the town seemed happy and the festival was fun until the fire happened.
			- Investigate [Ybbrinth Church](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/ybbrinth-church.md) and [Ybbrinth Cemetery](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/cemetery.md)
				- If they talk with the father, see 'Investigate the cause of the fire' -> 'Investigate [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md)' -> 'Ask around town about him' -> '[Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md)'
				- If they investigate the graves, ask for Int (Investigation).
					- If they beat DC 13, a few of the graves are disturbed.
					- If they beat DC 15, they notice a grave robber's footprints. The feet are unshod, bipedal, elongated, and clawed.
					- A DC 13 Int (Religion) indicates that the footprints belong to a ghoul. This is true, but the ghoul's presence is recent.
					- In truth, the ghoul merely followed the population of the nearby village of Habring Springs, as they made their way to the festival. That night one of [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md)'s guild member's will hunt the slavering monster down and end it, unless the party does it first.
					- The footprints lead to the town river and end there.
					- The monster has a hidey hole a few miles south of town, close to the river.
				- If they investigate the church, they might find [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md)'s longsword and dagger.
		- Investigate the [Abandoned Dormitories of the Monastery of the Arches](../../../place/landmark/building/ybbrinth/abandoned-monastery-dorms.md).
			- If he isn't with the party, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) will be present when they arrive. He doesn't ask why the party are there. He immediately assumes that they learned of the cultists using the dorms for their nefarious purposes.
			- He asks the party to help him search for clues.
			- With a DC 17 Int (Investigation) check, after an hour of investigation, the party are the first to find a hidden trap door in the abandoned kitchen. Otherwise, it takes ~3 hours for the Earl to find it instead.
			- After this, see [Below the Abandoned Dormitories](../unexplored/below-abandoned-dorms.md).
	- Guard the Inn.
		- Not much will happen.
		- Later into the night, [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) and [Huntmaster Stanislav Utƒõkal](../../../creature/unique/npc/trade/wounded-coast/utekal-stanislav.md) will be found dead, having fought to the death. The Earl will be revealed to have been a vampire.
		- [Mother Wilhelmina Yrstrone](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/yrstrone-wilhelmina.md) will reach out to them unless they're dead. [Father Peter Freitag](../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md) will reach out to them otherwise.
	- Hunt the Thesselhydra
		1. Go to Shawforth Forest to pick up the trail.
		2. A woman was attacked and her apples are scattered across the ground.
		3. Seek out the monster
			- Follow the tracks.
			- Seek out and wait at the next place of attack, a sheep pen at the forest's edge.

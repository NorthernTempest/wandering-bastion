## Pre-Session Notes

- [ ] The main event
	 - [ ] The party rolls initiative. They have 3 goals:
		 - [ ] Lead the people out of the cathedral
			 - DC 13
			 - +2 Str (Athletics), Wis (Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival), Cha
			 - -2 Dex, Int (Investigate)
			 - Successes
				 - 1 - 4: 20(n)% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 3: The party members working on this task are recognized as heroes by the survivors. +2 to lead the people out of the cathedral.
				 - 5: 90% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 6: 95% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 7: 98% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 8: 99% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 9: 100% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. This challenge ends.
			 - Failures:
				 - 1: Jacqueline Sachs, a brown-eyed brunette middle aged mother of two who worked as a manager at the town general store dies when the floor collapses under her and a pew falls on her, crushing her skull. 3% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, Jacqueline provides the party a 20% discount on goods and services purchased at the general store.
				 - 2: Mayor Ibram Woln, a sharp-eyed career politician from Wickerpool dies when one of the chains holding up a chandelier above her snaps. The oil held in the chandelier pours onto her and catches on fire, burning her alive. Wickerpool will hold an election when news of her death reaches the city and Alderman Nuthra Surina will be elected to replace her. 8% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If this fate is avoided, she will personally provide accommodations and protections inside the city of Wickerpool, guaranteeing the safety of the party members regardless of their actions in the city.
				 - 3: Mother Wilhelmina, a heavy-set and eternally cheerful leader of the monastery is found dead, having passed away due to smoke inhalation. Her ash-and-char-coated corpse will later be extricated from the rubble and she will become venerated as a martyr and a saint. Parts of her body and belongings will be cut up and passed around the world as holy relics. In the aftermath of the fire, the monastic order of the arches disbands. It will take 4 years before another organization takes control of L'Arc Chantante if it still stands. 15% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, she will provide housing to the party in the monastery dorms.
				 - 4: Huntmaster Stanislav, a tall broad shouldered man known for his feats of adventuring prowess and great strength dies when a pair of Efreeti trap him between two Walls of Fire and burn him alive. The survivors' and townsfolk's opinion of the party sours. While within the town or while talking to someone related to a victim of the fire, party members have a 50% chance of taking disadvantage on Cha (Persuasion, Bluff) checks except to convince those people that a party member has performed an evil deed. 25% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends. If this fate is avoided, Stanislav will later grant each member of the party lifetime membership to his guild.
				 - 5+: An additional 10% of the occupants of the cathedral at the start of the fire have died. If all other occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
			 - Turns:
				 - 1 - 6: Minimum 7n% of the occupants have been saved, up to 100% minus the current amount of dead occupants according to the failures. If all living occupants have been rescued, this challenge ends.
				 - 2: Someone panics, and people start pushing and rushing for the doors. -2 to all ability checks other than Cha, until a successful Cha check. 
				 - 4+: Smoke inhalation is becoming a severe problem for those who haven't escaped the fire. -2 to all checks other than Wis (Medicine), but +2 to Wis (Medicine) until the end of the challenge.
				 - 6: The exits have collapsed. -4 to any check that isn't Str (Athletics) until the next success.
		 - [ ] Investigate the cause of the fire before the culprits escape
			 - DC 15
			 - +2 Dex (Stealth, Acrobatics), Int (Investigation), Wis (Perception), Cha (Deception, Persuasion)
			 - -2 Str, Cha (Intimidate)
			 - Successes:
				 - 1: Hooded figures were seen gathering near the abandoned dorms, but disappeared before 11:00.
				 - 2: [Earl Nolthe Torbogenf√§llt](../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md) went to investigate the sighting shortly before the figures disappeared, and didn't reappear until 11:55.
				 - 3: There's evidence of a scroll of Gate having been used to call the elementals from the Plane of Fire. It was cast moments before the fire was first spotted.
				 - 4: The caster who caused the fire doesn't breath or bleed and they don't experience pain. A DC 10 Int (Religion) check confirms that the caster must be undead.
				 - 5: The caster appears to have been in a state of panic as they cast the spell.
				 - 6: The caster appears to be a male human and someone of high social standing. You have a rendering of their footprints to compare against if you gain access to a suspects' footwear. This skill challenge ends.
			 - Failures:
				 - 1: An essential clue is overlooked. -2 to future checks to investigate the cause.
				 - 2: A key witness is found dead. -4 to future checks to investigate the cause.
				 - 3: You follow a red herring, wasting time. The party member that triggered this failure misses their next turn.
				 - 4: You've lost the trail. This skill challenge ends.
			 - Turns:
				 - 0: The occupants of the cathedral are somewhat unafraid. Their gossip makes the investigation easier. Ignore failures until the next turn event.
				 - 1 - 3: Panic has beset the occupants of the cathedral, Int (Investigation), Wis (Perception), and Cha (Deception, Persuasion) checks take a -2 penalty, but Dex (Stealth) gains a +2 bonus until the next turn event.
				 - 3+: Clues burn away into smoke and ash. 50% chance each turn to gain a failure.
				 - 4+: Smoke inhalation is becoming a severe problem for those who haven't escaped the fire. -2 to all checks until the end of the challenge.
		 - [ ] Minimize the damage
			 - DC 15
			 - +2 Con (Athletics), Cha (Persuasion), Int (Investigation), Wis (Survival)
			 - -3 Dex, Wis (Perception), Cha (Deception)
			 - Successes:
				 - 1 - 19: The fire can be fought. The people are encouraged. +1 to checks to lead the people out of the cathedral.
				 - 3 - (8n-5) - 19: Elementals approach the party. 1d3-1 magmins, 20% chance of a smoke mephit, and 1d4-2 magma mephits. Stop the challenge to fight the elementals.
				 - 20: The fire is out. End the 'Lead the people out of the cathedral' skill challenge and enact all remaining success events in that challenge.
			 - Failures:
				 - 0: The cathedral will be repaired over the next few decades. The party cannot identify the Themesian gate from the burned building.
				 - 1: The cathedral can be rebuilt, but it will take a century or more. *The party does not automatically identify the Themesian gate from the remains of the building and the DC to do so during the investigation is DC 20.*
				 - 3: The cathedral will never be rebuilt, *but the charred ruins hide the Themesian gate from the party. The DC to identify the gate during the investigation is DC 16. End the 'Investigate the cause of the fire before the culprits escape' skill challenge.*
				 - 5: The cathedral will never be rebuilt. The outline of the Themesian gate is one of the more obvious remaining standing structures. At this point, have the party make a DC 14 Int (History) check to recall the [Five Errant Gates](../../../item/magic/5-errant-gates.md) and identify this as one of them. The cathedral collapses. End the 'Lead the people out of the cathedral' skill challenge and enact all remaining failure events in that challenge.
				 - 7: The cathedral has been burned to little more than ashes. The Themesian gate is the one thing that remains standing. At this point, have the party make a DC 12 Int (History) check to recall the [Five Errant Gates](../../../item/magic/5-errant-gates.md) and identify this as one of them.
			 - Turns (init 10):

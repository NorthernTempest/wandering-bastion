### Notes:

1. The shikigami watches over a long forgotten waystone that is about to fall into the Irnmar river. He offers to the party the chance to have it join them as a guide along the river, as that has always been its purpose. If they repair his waystone before the river claims it, the shikigami will automatically grant one success to the party once per turn on the challenge "Search the Mihrttal Expanse" Repairing the warding sigils on the waystone's face or building a weir downstream of the waystone can both solve the issue.
2. The river has been blocked by fallen trees here, and 12 kodama sit upon the shore nearby. These kodama have been injured in the process of protecting their trees from "mysterious visitors like yourselves". At first, they refuse the party to pass, believing that they or others like them will be attacked by these intruding visitors to the expanse. If the party attacks them, they will fight. Each have the statistics of an assassin vine with half the normal number of hit points.
3. The town is populated by the kami, but they don't leave their homes until night time. If the party arrive during the day, they will suddenly experience intense pangs of hunger, and they will find the food they have brought has been reduced to ghostly wisps. Food has been set out at food stalls, around the market and the party are preternaturally drawn to the sight and smell of it. DC 17 Wis save or Suggestion, as the spell: "go ahead and dine on the food, you can pay for it later". If you succeed the save, you will take 3 levels of exhaustion, which are removed as soon as the party member is able to leave the town. It turns out that the townsfolk are perfectly happy to provide food, lodging, even any other needs or comforts the party desire, so long as they pay fairly for the goods and services in gold, although those prices will be 20x higher here. They will refuse any other currency and, if the party cannot pay in full, the party will be required to work off the debt, at the rate of 5 gp / day (which will increase the DC of this skill challenge for each day spent here). There's a further complication. If any party member eats the food there, they will be physically unable to leave the town until they have Remove Curse cast on them, or they pay 500 gp for medicine to break the curse. Meanwhile, any party members that stay there for more than 8 hours without eating the local food will slowly begin to fade from world. At 16 hours, they will become incorporeal and at 24 total hours spent in the town over the course of two days, they will fade completely out of existence. Any who have eaten the local food are immune to fading from the world, even if they have been cured of the curse.
4. The party comes across a bridge as ancient as the forest itself. The party members may attempt a gm hidden perception check against DC 17 to spot a toshigami. If any succeed, the one who rolled the highest immediately notices the woman made of wood, and are drawn to her. She locks eyes with them and they immediately feel the forces of fate pull them together. Before anyone in the party is aware, they are all standing atop the bridge, approaching a towering and ancient cherry tree at the base of which stands the toshigami. Her name is Mai, and she has heard of the party. She asks that the person who she locked eyes with takes from her a token. She hands them a large cherry bud from the truly enormous tree behind her. "This will prove your alliance with the Kami. It will also prove your dire and urgent need. Most of all, it will prove our need for you." Suddenly, the party are back in their barge. The bridge is out of sight, and they are continuing their journey upriver. If all party members fail the check, tell them that a cherry tree in brilliant pink blossom towers over the other trees around it comes briefly into view, but passes out of sight once you pass the bridge.
5. The kami from the surrounding area are all somewhat uncomfortable when the party approach them. The kami call the potential campsite inhospitable, if questioned about it, and they aren't entirely wrong. The clearing is inhabited by a shinigami, though that shinigami's home is hidden from mortal eyes. The presence of the shinigami is what prevents plant life from growing here. The only way for a mortal to visit the shinigami's home is by performing a three part process:
	1. Circle around a specific but innocuous stone in the middle of the clearing 5 times in a clockwise direction by taking exactly 13 steps.
	2. Lift the stone, pass under it, and put it down in the same spot. Until the first step is done, the stone is preternaturally heavy, and cannot be lifted.
	3. Without turning away from the stone, walk backwards 5 paces in the direction that you first approached the stone from.

Ybbrinth is a small town on the edge of [Arcfall River](../arcfall.md), nestled deep in the hills of the [Arsleaf Peninsula](../index.md). One of its major features is the [L'Arc Chantante](../../../../landmark/building/larc-chantante.md) which sits across the river from the town, the grandest and possibly most ancient cathedral in all the world.

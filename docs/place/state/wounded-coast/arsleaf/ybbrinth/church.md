A small church that sits between the [Ybbrinth Cemetery](cemetery.md), to the south, and [Earl Ybbrinth](../../../../../creature/unique/npc/govern/wounded-coast/torbogenfallt-nolthe.md)'s estate. Few residents of [Ybbrinth](index.md) attend this church because of the nearby cathedral [L'Arc Chantante](../../../../landmark/building/larc-chantante.md) which is far more prestigious. It is overseen by [Father Peter Freitag](../../../../../creature/unique/npc/faith/wounded-coast/freitag-peter.md).

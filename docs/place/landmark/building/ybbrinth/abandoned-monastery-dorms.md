title: Abandoned Dormitories of the Monastery of the Arches
---

An old building in the [Monastery of the Arches](../../complex/monastery-of-the-arches.md) built to house the members of the [Monastic Order of the Arches](../../../../creature/org/faith/arcundus/monastic-order-of-the-arches.md) over a thousand years ago. They've been uninhabited since the more modern set of dormitories was constructed 90 years ago.

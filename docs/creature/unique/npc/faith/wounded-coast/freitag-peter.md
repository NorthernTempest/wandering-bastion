Manages the small [Ybbrinth Church](../../../../../place/state/wounded-coast/arsleaf/ybbrinth/church.md) that overlooks the cemetery in [Ybbrinth](../../../../../place/state/wounded-coast/arsleaf/ybbrinth/index.md). His flock is quite small because of the much more prestigious cathedral [L'Arc Chantante](../../../../../place/landmark/building/larc-chantante.md) nearby.

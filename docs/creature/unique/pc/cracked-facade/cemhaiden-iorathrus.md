Io started his adventure passing through the stalls at the [Sunspark Festival](../../../../event/recurring/holiday/sunspark-festival.md). He made use of [L'Arc Chantante](../../../../place/landmark/building/larc-chantante.md)'s vast library, where he searched for more information about the [Gnostic Order](../../../org/ideo/gnostic-order.md).

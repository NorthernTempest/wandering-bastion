A cult of personality around [Pux](../../../unique/npc/crime/global/cult-pux-redric/pux.md) and [Redric](../../../unique/npc/crime/global/cult-pux-redric/redric.md). The scope of its organization is unknown, but their goal appears to be to retake the [Six Lost Planets](../../../../place/planet/6-lost-worlds.md) from the aberrant horde.

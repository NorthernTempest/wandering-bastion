# Wandering Bastion Campaign Setting

This magical kitchen sink campaign setting is originally made for use with Dungeons and Dragons 5e or Pathfinder 1e. Its core theme is fantasy with elements of horror, folk tales, comedy, sci-fi, and more.

The site is available to read at <https://wandering-bastion.northerntempest.ca/> All the setting knowledge the players have accumulated through the campaign will appear here, as will the homebrew and session notes. The site is created with [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

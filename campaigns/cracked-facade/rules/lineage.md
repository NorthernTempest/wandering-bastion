# Lineages

The different lineages below are the more common lineages in this setting. If you'd like another lineage to work with, Jesse can create others on request. Feel free to request lineages that aren't available in Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

Although none are listed here, anthropomorphic animal-related lineages like Aarakocra, Tabaxi, Kenku, Lizardfolk, Minotaurs, Mermaids, Centaurs, etc. are, collectively, another 'core' lineage in this setting, known as 'Beastfolk' with a large degree of diversity. Also, besides Aasimar (with blood from Angels from the NG plane of Paradisia in this setting) and Tieflings (with blood from Devils from the LE plane of Hell), there are similar lineages for each of the 16 planes in the [Extreme Circuit](../../../lore/places/planes/outer/extreme-circuit/index.md) of the [Outer Planes](../../../lore/places/planes/outer/index.md) (although I haven't named any yet).

Age:
- Adulthood at 18

- Celestial Revelation: When you reach 3rd level, choose one of the revelation options below. Thereafter, you can use a bonus action to unleash the celestial energy within yourself, gaining the benefits of that revelation. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. Once you transform using your revelation below, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest:
	- Necrotic Shroud. Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and ghostly, flightless wings sprout from your back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Until the transformation ends, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus
	- Radiant Consumption. Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For the duration, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Until the transformation ends, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus
	- Radiant Soul. Two luminous, spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation ends, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell.

Traits:
- Relentless Fortitude: You do not fall unconscious when you have 0 remaining hit points. When you have 0 hit points, you are still dying and must still make death saving throws as normal. As normal, you remove all death saving throws when you are healed, you gain a failed death saving throw when you would take damage, and critical hits against you deal two failed death saving throws. Because you aren't unconscious, melee attacks do not automatically count as critical hits, and you are still able to take actions as normal. You may stay conscious after dropping to 0 hit points a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses of this ability after a long rest.
- Savage attacks: Whenever you deal critical damage, it does an additional amount of damage equal to that of a normal hit. That means that if you would normally do 2d6+5 damage on a hit, you instead deal 6d6+10 damage.
- Wanderer's Endurance: you may go up to 5 days without food, water, or sleep without taking any penalties from starvation, dehydration, or sleep-deprivation, but on the sixth day of starvation, dehydration, or sleep-deprivation, you take 5 levels of exhaustion at once. In order to end your starvation after missing one or more days of sleep, food, or water, you must eat that many days of food, drink that many days worth of water, or sleep for that many days worth of sleep in addition to the amount you need to survive for that day. If you do so before you are exhausted on the 6th day, you do not receive exhaustion, and if you do so after you've received the exhaustion, you recover all your levels of exhaustion.

# Lineages

The different races below are the more common races in this setting. If you'd like another lineage to work with, Jesse can create others on request. Of particular note, anthropomorphic lineages like Aarakocra, Tabaxi, Kenku, Lizardfolk, Minotaurs, Mermaids, and Centaurs are, collectively, another 'core' race in this setting, known as 'Beastfolk' with a large degree of diversity. Feel free to request races that aren't available in Dungeons and Dragons 5e.
